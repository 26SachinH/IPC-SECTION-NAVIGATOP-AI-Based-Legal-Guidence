# IPC-SECTION-NAVIGATOP-AI-Based-Legal-Guidence
Developed an advanced AI-driven legal recommendation system designed to analyze crime descriptions and automatically suggest the most relevant Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections. The project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques to understand legal context and provide precise section recommendations for crime-related cases.

**Key Contributions & Features:**

Built and fine-tuned multiple transformer-based models, including LegalBERT and BERT, to interpret complex legal text and predict applicable IPC sections.

Designed a multi-output recommendation framework that returns the top 3 IPC sections for each input, along with their section number, punishment, and detailed legal description.

Implemented an extensive data preprocessing pipeline, covering tokenization, text normalization, and feature extraction for legal text analytics.

Experimented with fine-tuning and custom model training from scratch to improve semantic understanding and achieve higher ROUGE and F1 scores.

Built a robust Flask-based backend API integrated with a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for seamless user interaction.

Enhanced the UI/UX with audio output, a cartoon-style animated assistant, blinking effects, and speech bubble synchronization to improve accessibility and engagement.

Developed a React-based authentication system for secure login and registration, ensuring smooth redirection to the main application without altering existing backend functionalities.

Integrated an AI-powered legal chatbot to handle user queries, perform case law searches, and assist in automated legal document generation, operating independently from the main model.

Planned the inclusion of a Power BI dashboard for visual analytics â€” enabling real-time insights into crime trends, IPC section frequency, and model performance.

Emphasized ethical AI design, ensuring transparency, fairness, and data privacy in legal decision-support systems.

**Tech Stack:**
Python | Flask | Transformers (LegalBERT, BERT) | PyTorch | TensorFlow | Scikit-learn | Pandas | NumPy | React.js | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Power BI

**Outcome:**
The system demonstrates how AI and NLP can modernize legal analysis, making it faster and more consistent while assisting legal professionals and law enforcement in identifying relevant IPC sections from narrative text.
